LIFE

### Living in The CPU

Purely an educational project.

Little bugs going about the electronic based life.

### Old Description

Project is using the ncurses library to print to the console with color and what not.
http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/

The idea for this program came from the digital life project in the *Eloquent Javascript*
textbook. All the code here is mine, and I made some significant additions, but the idea very much
belongs to EJ's author.
