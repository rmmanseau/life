LIFE
====

### Console based, Ascii Life.

The last project got a little messy and I figured it could benefit from a ground up rework.
I will go in hopefully making better decisions and overall improving to simplicity and
extendability of the project

### Old Description

This is a pretty small project I've been working on.
Using ncurses and c++, I have created ascii life.

This project is heavily inspired by the digital life project from the *Eloquent Javascript*
textbook. I did not reference his javascript implementation very much, but the idea very much
belongs to EJ's author.
http://eloquentjavascript.net/

The goal of this project is, primarily, to learn c++ and it has been very helpful in doing that.
However, I also just find it really entertaining to watch the tiny Ascii creatures go about
their lives.

Unlike the code in Fyz, I am to some extent proud of this code, and if anybody see's anything
that they feel could be improved somehow, please let me know. I want nothing more than to
continue learning from this project.

To anyone that ends up reading this, have a nice day.
