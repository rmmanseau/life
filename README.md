### Living in The CPU

Purely an educational project.

Little bugs going about their electronic based life.

The project is using the ncurses library to print to the console with color and what not.

The idea for this program came from the digital life project in the *Eloquent Javascript*
textbook. All the code here is mine, and I made some significant additions, but the idea very much
belongs to EJ's author.
